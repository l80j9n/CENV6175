Section A
A1. A breakwater built from vertical concrete   caissons   has   an entrance of width   LB    = 30 m with   a water   depth   of
3.57   m,   Fig. A1.   Both sides of the   breakwater at the entrance are vertical walls, the shipping channel   runs   in   the centre line of the entrance. The wave   periods   at   the   harbour range from 4 to   9   seconds. 
a)             At which two wave   periods can   standing waves   at   the entrance occur?
b)             Which wave   period   is   more   critical   and why?

A2. The wave breaking criterion given   in most   textbooks   states   that
waves break when the   ratio of wave height   H and water depth   d reaches a value of H / d   =   0.78.   Describe   briefly the   assumption underlying this value, using   sketches. Give two   points of critique   of   this condition for wave breaking. [   8   ]
A3. Name   and   briefly   describe   two   types   of   sustainable   solutions   for   coastal   structures   (use   sketches   where   appropriate).           [   8   ]
SECTION B 
B1. Sustainability
(i)   Name   and   briefly   describe   two   different   technologies for   electricity generation from tidal currents. Give typical   efficiencies and one advantage and one disadvantage for   each.        [   6   ]
(ii)   At a   beach, you can   identify a   rip current   by   the   fact   that   the   breaking waves   practically disappear over a   width   of several   meters. Outside   of   the   rip   current,   the   breaking   wave   height   is around   1   m.
a)   Explain the rip current generation mechanism   briefly, using   sketches.       [   4   ]
b) Why do   the   waves in the rip current   disappear?   Name and describe the effect   briefly.       [   5   ]
c)   Estimate (using calculations, assume shallow water   conditions)   the   velocity   of   the   rip   current.   Can   you   swim    against   the current    towards the shoreline?   Give evidence for your answer.       [   7   ]

B2. Tsunami   Engineering:
(i)               Briefly describe (with sketches) three different   mechanisms of tsunami generation. [   9   ] 
(ii)          A tsunami wave   breaking   near the   shoreline   can   be 
compared to a bore, with a constant horizontal   velocity v0   ,   Fig.   B2.1.

a)   Use a   momentum analysis with a   moving   reference   frame   to   determine   the   velocity   of   the    bore   as   a   function of the depth d and the bore height H.   Comment.       [   8   ]
b) The tsunami wave travels upstream in a water depth   of d   =   1   m. Assume the   height of the   bore to   be   H =   0.678   m.   Is   this   the   maximum   height   the   tsunami   wave   in   the   river   can   have?   Analyse   the   situation,   using moments over the seabed to determine   whether or not 0.678   m   is the   critical   height.       [   8   ]
B3. Wave forces on structuresFig.    B3.1    shows   a vertical seawall with the minimum   (MLWS) and maximum (MHWS) water levels. The   maximum offshore    wave height is H0 =   1.0 m, the   predominant   wave   period   for   all   wave   heights   is   T   =   8   seconds. The density of   the seawater is ρsw   = 1030 kg/m3   .Fig.   B3.1: Vertical seawall
Determine:
(i)             The type   and   magnitude   of   pressures   generated   by the waves at   MHWS. Give the   vertical
distribution of pressures.   Use   Eqs.   B3.1 and   B3.2.      Hint: tanh(x) and cosh(x) are   listed   in   Table   1   (p   6).    [   10   ]
(ii)            The type   and   magnitude   of the   maximum   pressure   generated   by   a   breaking   wave.   Use   two   iteration   steps   to   approximate   the   critical   water   depth.   Hint:   start   with   the   assumption   that   the    incident   wave   height   is equal to the   height determined for   a   depth   of 2.5   m.   Use   Eq.   B3.3 and Table 3.1.       [   10   ]
(iii)          The   maximum   pressure   at   MLWS.    Use    Eq.    B3.3   and Table   3.1.       [   5   ]
