Section A 
A1. There are two types of   wave overtopping. Describe   both   using         sketches and give the wave conditions required as   a function   of the   water   depth.       [   8   ]
A2. Briefly   describe   two   different   explanations   for   the   mechanism   of   wave   breaking. Use   sketches   where   appropriate.       [   8   ]
A3. Water   waves   can   be   dispersive. Briefly   describe   what   this   means,   under   which   conditions   occurs   and   give   an   example   where   this   characteristic is of practical   importance.       [   9   ]
SECTION B
B1. A harbour   operator intends   to extend the existing harbour   basin by a   rectangular mooring basin of 25   m length   and   9 m   width as shown in Fig. B1.1. Both harbour    and   extension   have   vertical   concrete   walls.   The   harbour   is   exposed   to   waves   with   wave    periods    ranging      from   a   minimum   of   T1       =   4   seconds   with   a   deep   water   wave   height of H01    =   1.0   m, and a   maximum wave   period of T2   =   16.1   seconds with   a   deep water wave   height   of   H02    =   0.5    m.    The    water    depth    just      outside      and      inside      the   harbour is constant at 4.0   m.

(i)                            Determine the wave   height at point ‘1’ for T1    and   T2   .   Use   Fig.   B1.2       [   7   ]
(ii)                         In the initial   proposal, the   depth   in   the   extension   is   assumed   to   be   constant   at   4   m.   Assess   the   proposed   extension,   and   comment   on   whether    you   recommend   it.                                                                                                                                                                                       [ 9 ]
(iii)                      In a second proposal, the harbour operator   suggests to   install a   beach in   the   extension   with   a   maximum   water   depth   of 4   m   at   the   harbour   side of   the extension,   and   water   depth at   the land   end of close to zero.
a)   Is this beneficial?
b) The   harbour   operator   states   that   small   boats   can be moored up to   a depth of 1.0   m.   Assess   the   situation.       [   9   ]

B2. Tsunamis:A   tsunami   wave   arrives   at   the   shoreline   with   an   incident   wave   height at   breaking   of Hb    =   2.40   m, and   a   wave   period   of 500 seconds.
(i)                            Determine the offshore wave   heig代 写CENV6175 COASTAL AND MARITIME ENGINEERING SEMESTER 1 ASSESSMENT PAPER 2022/23C/C++

(ii)                        Assuming   the   coastline   to   be   vertical   with   a   water   depth of   3.0 m, as shown in Fig. B2.1, determine the   initial velocity of the wave and its   Froude number at   landfall,   for   the case of the tsunami    wave    crest   arriving   first.   Use   a   momentum   approach. Assume   the   wave   crest to   constitute   a   bore   when   it   arrives   at   the   coastline.       [   9   ]
(iii)                      Approximately 10 m landwards of the coastline   there   is   a   vertical   tsunami   wall   with   a   height   of 6.0   m.   Will   the   wall   be   overflown?   Assume   the   initial   bore to   have the same   velocity   and   height   it   has   at   landfall   as   determined   in   section   B2   (ii).   Use   two   iteration steps, and approximate the final value        [   11   ]

B3. Sustainability and environment:
(i)                           A   tidal   current   has   a   maximum   velocity   of 5.5   m/s.   A   developer   wants   to   install   a   5   m   diameter   tidal   turbine in the current. Assuming a turbine efficiency   for the complete swept area of 0.35, and a   generator   efficiency   of   0.8. Determine   the   electrical   power   output.        [   9   ]
(ii)                         The   same   developer   also   wants   to    build   a   wavepower   installation   at   the   shoreline   where   the   water   depth      is      2      m.    The       seabed      slope      is      1:10,      the   prevailing   wave   period   is   T   =   8   seconds   with   an   average      offshore    wave       height      of      H0          =       2.1      m.   Assuming a width of   the installation of 10 m, and an   overall   power   conversion   efficiency   wave-to-wire   of   0.25,   determine   the   power   output   for   the   average   wave   conditions.       [   8   ]
(iii)                      A   river   estuary   has   a   water   depth   of   2.5   m,   and   a   flow velocity of 3.0   m/s.   On   a   stormy day, waves   of   a   period   of   6   seconds   are   seen   to   break   on   both   sides   of   the   estuary,   the   water    in   the    estuary   is   however   calm   with   hardly   a   visible   wave.   Analyse and   explain   the   situation.       [   8   ]
Assume shallow water conditions throughout. The density of seawater is ρsw    =   1030   kg/m3   .
