Section A 
A1.       A developer wants to build a 3   m   high   reinforced   concrete seawall   as   part of a   new   hotel.   Residents question the sustainability of the   approach.   Briefly discuss the sustainability aspects of reinforced concrete, and describe a more sustainable design   using   concrete      as   material.       [   8   ]
A2. Describe an   N-wave, its characteristics   and   give   an   example   where such a wave can   occur.       [   8   ]
A3. There are two wave breaking conditions. Describe both briefly and   give the relevant formulas for breaking wave   heights.       [   9   ]
SECTION B
B1. (i)             Figure   B1.1 shows   a   harbour   basin   for   leisure   craft.The   harbour has concrete side walls,   and   a   caisson   breakwater. There are reports of large   waves   inside   the      harbour      basin, even when there are only   moderate waves with a period T of around 10   seconds   outside   of   the harbour.   A local offshore   service provider company was asked to conduct   wave measurements. The company installed a   seabed   wave   height   sensor   at   point   ‘1’,   Fig.   B1.1.   Despite   further reports   from harbour users about   high   waves,   the   measurements   did   not   show   any   significant wave   heights. Analyse and comment.
Assume the water depth inside the   harbour to   be   a   constant 5.0   m.

(ii)                            Fig   B1.2 shows   a seawall with   a   water   depth   of   1.5   m.   The   design wave   period   is   4.4   seconds,   the offshore wave height H0 is 1.5 m. The   seawall has to be designed for the current   condition,   and   for   an   expected   sea level    rise   (SLR)   of 0.30   m.   The   seabed   is   smooth, with   a   bed    slope of 1:10. Assume a density of sea   water of ρsw    =   1030   kg/m3   .
Determine:a)                Type and magnitude of maximum wave load   (maximum pressure and   force) on the structure   without   SLR.        [   5   ]
b)       Type   and   magnitude   of   maximum   wave   load   with   SLR. Comment on   situation.        [   5   ]
c)            wave   condition   /   load   type   for   max   H0       =    1.2   m   without and with SLR. Comment代 写CENV6175 COASTAL AND MARITIME ENGINEERING SEMESTER 1 ASSESSMENT PAPER 2020/21

B2. Tsunamis:
A tsunami wave with a height   H0    =   1.0 m and a wave   period   of 500 seconds   is generated in a water   depth   of 2,000   m.
(i)                            Determine the wave condition (shallow          /
intermediate   /   deep   water)   of   the   tsunami   wave   at   its   origin.        [   5   ]
(ii)                         Determine the maximum wave   height   Hmax      near the   coastline,   using the conservation of energy and   the   breaking wave condition.        [   8   ]
(iii)                      The tsunami wave of height H   max arrives at theshoreline   as   an   N-wave,   with   a   preceding   trough.   Assuming the wave to constitute a boreas shown in   Fig.   B2.1, and   using a small   control volume with   an   energy principle, determine its speed of   propagation.       [   5   ]
(iv)                      Compare   the    result   with   the   standard   formula   for
wave celerity in shallow water,   comment   briefly.        [   7   ]

B3. Wave   refraction:
(i)                           A   developer   suggests   the   construction   of   a   wave   power station. There are two   possible sites,   one   on   a    headland   and   one in   a bay.   At    both   sites,   the   waves approach the coastline with the wave crest in   deeper water   near   parallel   to the   coast. Which   site   is   preferrable,   and   why?   Explain   your   answer   with   sketches.       [   9   ]
(ii)                         Fig.   B3.1   shows   a   wave   of   height   H1       =    1.0   m   andperiod   T    =    5    seconds    propagating    from    a    water   depth of d1    = 3.0 m into a water depth   of d2    = 5.0   m.   The   wave   crest   arrives   with   an   angle   of   α   1       =   35   degrees with the contour   line.
(a)      Determine the wave direction and wave   height for the water depth d2   .       [   8   ](b)    The      wave      direction      changes      to      α   1   ’      =      75   degrees,what   is   the   wave   height   and   direction   in   the deeper water?           [   8   ]
Assume shallow water conditions throughout.
