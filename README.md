Section A 
A1. A 5   m wide wave power station is   designed   using   physical   model      tests with a scale of   1:10. The full scale   incident wave   height   is   Hi         =   1.5   m, the wave   period T =   11 seconds, the water depth   is   3   m.      Determine the wave parameters and the available wave   power for   the   model scale. Assume shallow water conditions.   Formulas are      given on   pages 9   and   10.       [      8      ]
A2. Describe a simple model   for   depth   induced   wave   breaking,
including a sketch and formulas. Compare the   model with the   general assumption for shallow water wave breaking.        [      8      ]
A3. In   many   harbours   there   are   vertical   quay walls which   reflect   waves   and   may   make   standing   waves   possible.   Briefly   describe   a   standing wave   using   sketches.   Can   a   standing   wave   be   higher   than   the   waves outside the harbour? Briefly describe two methods to avoid   the build-up of standing waves   in   harbours.            [   9   ]

SECTION B 
B1. A    tsunami    wave    at    breaking    has    an    estimated    waveheight   of   H1      =   3.0   m   (from   observations).   The   tsunami   consists of a wave train with a period of    T    =      1,200   seconds. The epicentre of the earthquake which   caused   the tsunami   is   located   at a water   depth   of   d0      =   1,800   m.   The   incoming   tsunami   at   landfall   is   idealised   as   a   bore   traveling with a   near vertical front, which   has   a   height   of   hB    = 3.0   m, and   a velocity   of vB    =   7   m/s.
(i)   Determine the offshore wave   height   H0    of the tsunami   in   1,800   m depth   (Eq.’s   B1.1 and   1.2).        [   5   ]
(ii) The land   has a   gentle   slope with   a   friction   free   surface, determine the   maximum run-up   height.        [   5   ]
(iii)   It   is   planned to build a vertical tsunami wall   close   to      the shoreline.   Determine the maximum run-up   height   tW at the wall, assuming the   tsunami to constitute   a   reflected   bore of initial   height tB    =   3.0   m.   Use an iterative procedure (hint: start with water   depth tW    at   the   wall of tW    = 2.5 tB   , where tB    = 3.0m).   Three   iteration steps are sufficient. [   10   ]
(iv) Comment on the result,   considering the   height   of   the total energy line of the   incoming tsunami wave.       [代 写CENV6175 COASTAL AND MARITIME ENGINEERING

B2. Wave theory:(i)             A 200   m   long   harbour   basin   has   a   depth   of 7   m   depth,   and a width 50   m.   The   harbour walls   are   vertical.   Estimate   the longest wave periods for standing waves in both   directions,   using   linear   wave   theory.   Which   wave   is   more   critical, and why?       [   9   ](ii)            A lake has a fetch length of 20 km, and a depth   of 9   m.   The   wind   speed   for   1   hour   duration   was   measured   as   30   m/s, at   5   m   height.
(a)          Determine the wave   height,   period   and   length   in
9   m water depth.   Hint   :   Use   Fig.   B2.1.           [   4   ]
(b)          At the windward end   of the   lake, there   is   a
beach.   Determine the wave   height and   length of the   wave in   3.0 water   depth.        [   5   ]
(iii)          From the formulas from linear wave theory for wave
length and wave energy, derive a shoaling   coefficient   ks for   the change in wave   height when the wave travels from deep water into shallow water. ks      is the   ratio   of shallow water wave   height   Hi   to deep water wave height   H0   , ks   =   Hi/H0    (see   Eq.   B2.2). [   7   ]

B3. Wave diffraction:   The harbour shown in Fig B3.1 has to be designed   for (1) a wave period of T1   = 6 seconds and an offshore wave height   of   H01    = 2.3   m, and   (2) for a wave   with   a   period   of T2      =   12   seconds   and   a   deep   water   wave   height   of   H02      =   1.8   m.   The   water   depth   d   inside and outside of the harbour is   constant,   with   d   =   10.0   m.(i) Determine the maximum wave height / surface elevations   at   points ‘1’ at the   harbour wall,   and   point ‘2’   in   the   harbour   basin for T1    = 6 seconds.   Use   Fig.   B3.2. [   8   ] 
(ii)   Determine the wave   height at point ‘2’ for T2      =   12   seconds.   Use   Fig.   B3.2.       [   6   ]
